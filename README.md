The developed application is a personal finance management tool that allows individuals to track their income and expenses, list cash flows on a weekly/monthly/yearly basis, access current exchange rates, and monitor budget allocations for each category. The application is developed using the Swift programming language. It leverages services provided by the Firebase platform such as Firebase Authentication and Firestore.
